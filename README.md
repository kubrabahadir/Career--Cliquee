# KariyerYa

The aim of this project is to provide a career field for users who want to establish a career network with universities and companies through real-time communication. Users apply for event announcements organized by companies, universities, or both, through other platforms. If they do not have an account on KariyerYa, they create an account and log in. They can then participate by going to the join now page with the codes provided and entering their names and code. For a more effective career network, they can reach their friends at university or employee profiles in companies and contact them via e-mail or link.
